# Formal Reasoning About Programs

This is an in-progress, open-source book by [Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net/) simultaneously introducing [the Coq proof assistant](http://coq.inria.fr/) and techniques for proving correctness of programs.  That is, the game is doing completely rigorous, machine-checked mathematical proofs, showing that programs meet their specifications.

Just run `make` here to build everything, including the book `frap.pdf` and the accompanying Coq source modules.
